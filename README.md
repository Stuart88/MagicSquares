# MagicSquares
Short program for finding magic squares

A magic square is one where all rows and columns, and the two diagonals from corner to corner, add up to the same number. As well as this, the square must not contain any number more than once.

Example:

|4  -  9  -  2|

|3  -  5  -  7|

|8  -  1  -  6|

The rows, columns and diagonals all add to 15
